# Programming for Data Science with Python Nanodegree Program
Currently this is to meet the requirement for Project Three and contains only Project two detail, I will however update this to reflect my journey throughout the nanodegree.

### Date created
01 May 2021

### Project Title
Explore US Bikeshare Data

### Description
In this project, you will use data provided by [Motivate](https://www.motivateco.com/), a bike share system provider for many major cities in the United States, to uncover bike share usage patterns. You will compare the system usage between three large cities: Chicago, New York City, and Washington, DC.

### Files used
1. File containing necessary pyhon code:
   * bikeshare.py	
2. The following files are too large and were excluded in my remote repo using **.gitignore** :
   * chicago.csv
   * new_york_city.csv
   * washington.csv
